# Predicting-Bike-Rentals-Count-Using-ML
We are predicting the bike rental counts using machine learning and H2O Auto ML.

# Introduction
Main aim of the project is to predict bike rental count on hourly or daily basis based on the environmental and seasonal factors
using ML and Auto ML techniques.

# Project Flow 

1) Data Analysis - Finding out Different relations.

2) Feature Engineering - Processing the data before it feeding to the model.

3) Model Building using ML - Using ML/Dl Algorithms.

4) Model Building using Auto ML.
